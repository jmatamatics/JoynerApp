# LLM Powered RAG Application
This repo shows how to create a RAG system using Langchain and OpenAI.
A streamlit is created, allowing you to upload PDFs and embed them to a vectostore. You can then ask the Chatbot questions based on the files loaded.
Along with the response, the source document will be returned. Access it [here](https://llm-powered-rag-application.streamlit.app/).
